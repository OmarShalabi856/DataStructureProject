# Quiz-Application
This is my 3rd semester data strcutures project. The main idea of this project is utilizing several data structures (queues,stacks,linkedlists...) in making  a quiz application using
Java programming Language. There are preset quiz categories where the user can take the exam from or the the admin can add a new categor. In addition the admin can correct taken exams and submit a grade after correction
